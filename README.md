This was a fun multimodal device project I worked on in my first semester of my senior year! It was incredibly fun to use and learn more about Unity, C#, and how motion sensors can integrate with both interfaces.

The project requires an Ultraleap Motion Controller (the version is up to you, but I used the Leap Motion Controller 2). Right now, you can change the volume of "Talkback" by 6LACK by moving your hand up and down.

I'm currently working on:

○ User input tracks

○ Choice between pitch, reverb, and speed control

○ Choice between different hand models
